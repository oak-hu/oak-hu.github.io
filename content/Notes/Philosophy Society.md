## Week 1: 'Separation is Foundation' (Claudio Calosi)

Calosi is quite funny (and really cool-looking). Opened with the note that he'd been drinking, so this would be quite fun.

Realism about the wavefunction is the view that the wavefunction represents an objective, physically significant, observer independent aspect of the world.

Comes in many varieties:

(1) Multi-field that specifies a field-value for each n-tupe of points in 3D space; (2) a property-like entity (say, a disposition) of the mereological sum of the particles; (3) sui-generis entity that does not fit in any of our classical ontological categories. (Note n is the total number of particles.)

Field Realism: The wavefunction represents a field in 3n dimensional configuration space. 

WF Fundamentalism: The wavefunction field defined over the 3n dimensional configuration space is part of the fundamental ontology.

HDWF: If something belongs to the fundamental ontology of (non

Everything in 3D space is determined by the WF field evolving in space. (Compare big names like Ney, Sider, etc)

One of the main arguments for HDWF rests on separability. Has been motivated by simplicity, intuitiveness. Recently, Maudlin has challenged these, has concluded that there are literally no toher motivations in favor or separability.

This talk (1) explores the neglected relation between separability and fundamentality; (2) motivates separability by showing how the fact that an ontology is separable can provide an argument for its fundamentality.

The canonical argument from separability:

Motivational Premise: Separability, locality are among desirable features of a fundamental metaphysics. Thus, separability and locality can motivate metaphysical choices for the fundamental level.

Uniqueness Premise: HDWF is the only metaphysics of QM that is both separable and local. (Some think this is false, actually!)

Conclusion: Be a HDWF realist!

First stab at SEP: A plurality of entities is separable iff (1) they're 'independent', and (2) there's a 'composition and determination' condition.

(1) can be read in two ways, leading to two different sep=notions

Strong: iff the state of any entity in the purality is not determined by any other entity, and for any entity that is composed by entities in the plurality the state of the composed entity is determined by the states of its components.

Weak: iff the state of any entity in the plurality is not determined by any other entity that is not a component of it; and (2) as above.

Sep is non-causal metaphysical determination; whereas locality is causal determination.

Logical framework: 

Extensionality: Pluralities xx and yy are identical iff they have the same members.

Plural Comprehension

No emptiness: There are no empty pluralities.

Call one-member pluralities 'improper'

A proper subplurality yy of xx is such that each y in yy is identical to a x in xx but not vice versa.

Add two primitives: a primitive notion of metaphysical determination D. The second is a 'composition operation', which we indicate with $\sigma$. 

D-relata: primarily fact-like entities of the form: 'the fact that xx are in state $\phi$ -- that is, each $x_i<xx$ is in state $\phi_i$ determines the fact that y is in state $\phi$.

D can be plural in both argument places; thus, e.g., yyDy reads 'the yy determine x'

D is transitive. (If the atoms determine the molecules, which determine the happiness, then the atoms determine the happiness.)

Finally, D is the relation of determination that appears in HDWF realism.

Component: x is a component of y iff y is the result of applying $\Sigma$ to $x$ and (possibly) some other object.

Parthood is the transitive closure of componenthood. 

Anti-cyclicity: if x=sigma(...(sigma(...,x,...),...) then x = sigma (....x...)

From these one can recover standard mereological notions. 

Note that sigma-compositoin is not identity. y=sigma(yy) and yy is a proper plurality, that is, it contains at least two members, then y!=yy. (Orthodoxy. But needed.)

Simple: x is simple iff there is no imporper plurality xx such that xx sigma x.

a plurality is simple if all parts are simple.

a plurality is a subdivision of another iff for everything in the first there is a member of the second such that x is part of y.

everything has atomic parts <=> atoms compose everything.

Strong: iff for each  in xx there is no y != x : yDx and (ii) for each compositve y exists subplurality yy of xx : y=sigma yy 

3d world is not separable. if we all agree that our intuitions are actually false even of the 3d world that actually generated them, why assumed they're true at all?

Fundamentally1: undetermined. (unexplained)
F2: determine everything. (explain everything)
f(12): undetermined all-determiners (unexplained all-explainers)

Strong => fundamental(12).

weak => fundamental(2)

sigma-simplicity => (weak sep => exists strong sep)

need determination principle: for every 3d entity x there is a configuration space plurality xx such that xx D x.

but converse fails. fundamentality(12) fails to entail the compositoin and determination condition. requires that for every derivative entity y there is a fundamental plurality xx that determines y. However it is completely silent as to whether y and xx are sigma-related as strong-separability demands.

so: want separability because it guarantees fundamentality.

bias towards f2 (orthodox may be f1): suppose x, y depend on each other, and determine everything else.

'You cannot throw injective functions at your mother, you have to throw dishes' (on why the set of three people didn't lift the table)

## Week 3: Is there more than physics?
**Sean Carroll (JHU)**

Exist questions about how the universe works which are best addressed thinking like a philosopher

Can have an accurate causal model of the world by abstracting to higher-level emergent things. But is there anything more than fundamental physics, where the top-level stuff is just approximations and commentary?

Epistemically: Clearly higher levels can be understood (stronger: are best understood) without thinking about lower levels.

Ontically: Do higher-level patterns qualify as "real"? (Yeah.)

'Super-ontological': "Does understanding higher levels require entirely new, independent entitites?" No.

- How it would be possible for there to be ontologically real entities not ultimately described by fundamental physics; and
- Why there probably are no such entities

> **Standard dichotomy**
> 
> Weak emergence: the theory is exact, but there are higher-level patterns that emerge upon coarse-graining
>
> Strong emergence: higher-level behavior is not compatible with lower-level rules. (Seems only possible if the lower-level theory is just wrong in some way.)

Emergence without judgments: 'new', 'surprising', 'novel' — not clear. Just talk about the dynamics: show what is involved in invoking new macro-entities. ('what emergence can possibly mean'

'I think they don't want weak emergence to count because it's easy to understand.'

A many-to-one map from lower level to higher level; commutes with evolution (can evolve via macro and then map to micro, or vice versa).

- particles to fluids
- center-of-mass motion
- quantum to classical


But these are delicate: you must compress the right information. Positions, momenta of 10^50 particles = excellent predictions; CoM, position, and momentum = excellent prediction (threw away almost all the data); but forgetting the momentum of even one particle = no prediction at all (consideR: in principle, could have just a Ton of momentum in the other direction).

Dennett "Real Patterns" (If I have this colection of moving particles, but I discover that there's a particular way of throwing away almost all the data and still making good predictions, that's an objective fact about the world!!!!! it's not just convenience.)

Ross & Ladyman "Structural REalism" : (


Strong Emergence: Higher-level phenomena are not deducible even in principle from lower-level dynamics (Chalmers).

They want credit both for being contrarian, but don't take their own ideas seriously. Remember: whatever consciousness is, electrons have something to do with it, and we have rules for how they behave. Do you think electrons behave differently inside the human brain, versus in the LHC???? 


A way for strong emergence to make sense:

Three possible inluences. 

Its own state

Local interactions with neighbors

(Done, if locality is true)

Non-local influences depending on overall context.


(change in subsystem) = (self-driven change) + (interactions with neighbors) + (filter function) x (novel influences)

Just a few particles = filter function almost zero; many particles in brain = filter function on.


The laws of physics underlying everyday life are (we have good reason to believe) completely known. 

How can we be so sure? The basic structure of QFT.

QFT is the unique low-energy theory compatible with : relativity, QM, locality.

We understand the dynamics of the known particles & forces (effective field theory)

No unknown particles / forces relevant to everyday life (crossing symmetry) — no consciousness.

Fermions (mass), Bosons (energy), Higgs boson , ..... the core theory.

Everyday life: low energy and weak gravity. Well within the the 10^11 eV tested limit.


Oh, yeah: matter is stuff made of fermions.

Explanatory dependence.

macro level: higher level emergent phenomena of everyday life | Astro, cosmology

QFT level: Known particles, forces, GR | Dark matter/energy, new particles/forces, hidden sectors

unknown levels: Deeper reality


Arros from each level to the below; except no arrows from life to dark matter/energy/new ...; or to deeper reality.


screened off by QFT.


QFT is the unique way to satisfy these foundational ideas:

1. Quantum mechanics
2. Special relativity
3. Local particle-like behavior at large distances (1% diameter of a proton)

Short distances (lmight be strings, spin networks, discrete spacetime, qubits, whatever.


An EFT is a field theory that only includes low-energy particles below a cutoff. (cf CoM dynamics).

At low energies, an EFT can be a self-contianed theory. at higher energies, new phenomena can kick in.

e.g. fermi model of weak interactions => standard model 


THIS is why the emergent phenomena can't depend on deeper reality; the core theory is an effective field theory; all the unknown stuff is already quantifiable.

you can hide things if they;re really short-range or really weakly interacting. But so we know how they're hidden.


If a new particle can interact with ordinary particles:

Then that particle can be created in high-energy collisions.

Because ('crossing symmetry') diagrams can be rotated.

They measure the in/out energy. If there's no missing energy, there's no room for them to be. (We look for that!).

Either: too heavy to make (so not in this room), or too weakly interacitng (so not affecting your brain).


Also experimental limits on new forces.


THIS is why new unknown particles / forces aren't relevant.


"They have written a lot of words. They have not told me exactly how they expect stuff to mess wtih ..'

Certainly there is a role for strong emergence between two 'higher' levels. (cells -> organism; people -> nations)



EFT, and within regime.



how much weight on the EFT stuff? like, couldn't make this argument 150 years ago?



filter function is just for convenience.
