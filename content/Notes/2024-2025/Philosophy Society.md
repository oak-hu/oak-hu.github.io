## Week 1: 'Separation is Foundation' (Claudio Calosi)

Calosi is quite funny (and really cool-looking). Opened with the note that he'd been drinking, so this would be quite fun.

Realism about the wavefunction is the view that the wavefunction represents an objective, physically significant, observer independent aspect of the world.

Comes in many varieties:

(1) Multi-field that specifies a field-value for each n-tupe of points in 3D space; (2) a property-like entity (say, a disposition) of the mereological sum of the particles; (3) sui-generis entity that does not fit in any of our classical ontological categories. (Note n is the total number of particles.)

Field Realism: The wavefunction represents a field in 3n dimensional configuration space. 

WF Fundamentalism: The wavefunction field defined over the 3n dimensional configuration space is part of the fundamental ontology.

HDWF: If something belongs to the fundamental ontology of (non

Everything in 3D space is determined by the WF field evolving in space. (Compare big names like Ney, Sider, etc)

One of the main arguments for HDWF rests on separability. Has been motivated by simplicity, intuitiveness. Recently, Maudlin has challenged these, has concluded that there are literally no toher motivations in favor or separability.

This talk (1) explores the neglected relation between separability and fundamentality; (2) motivates separability by showing how the fact that an ontology is separable can provide an argument for its fundamentality.

The canonical argument from separability:

Motivational Premise: Separability, locality are among desirable features of a fundamental metaphysics. Thus, separability and locality can motivate metaphysical choices for the fundamental level.

Uniqueness Premise: HDWF is the only metaphysics of QM that is both separable and local. (Some think this is false, actually!)

Conclusion: Be a HDWF realist!

First stab at SEP: A plurality of entities is separable iff (1) they're 'independent', and (2) there's a 'composition and determination' condition.

(1) can be read in two ways, leading to two different sep=notions

Strong: iff the state of any entity in the purality is not determined by any other entity, and for any entity that is composed by entities in the plurality the state of the composed entity is determined by the states of its components.

Weak: iff the state of any entity in the plurality is not determined by any other entity that is not a component of it; and (2) as above.

Sep is non-causal metaphysical determination; whereas locality is causal determination.

Logical framework: 

Extensionality: Pluralities xx and yy are identical iff they have the same members.

Plural Comprehension

No emptiness: There are no empty pluralities.

Call one-member pluralities 'improper'

A proper subplurality yy of xx is such that each y in yy is identical to a x in xx but not vice versa.

Add two primitives: a primitive notion of metaphysical determination D. The second is a 'composition operation', which we indicate with $\sigma$. 

D-relata: primarily fact-like entities of the form: 'the fact that xx are in state $\phi$ -- that is, each $x_i<xx$ is in state $\phi_i$ determines the fact that y is in state $\phi$.

D can be plural in both argument places; thus, e.g., yyDy reads 'the yy determine x'

D is transitive. (If the atoms determine the molecules, which determine the happiness, then the atoms determine the happiness.)

Finally, D is the relation of determination that appears in HDWF realism.

Component: x is a component of y iff y is the result of applying $\Sigma$ to $x$ and (possibly) some other object.

Parthood is the transitive closure of componenthood. 

Anti-cyclicity: if x=sigma(...(sigma(...,x,...),...) then x = sigma (....x...)

From these one can recover standard mereological notions. 

Note that sigma-compositoin is not identity. y=sigma(yy) and yy is a proper plurality, that is, it contains at least two members, then y!=yy. (Orthodoxy. But needed.)

Simple: x is simple iff there is no imporper plurality xx such that xx sigma x.

a plurality is simple if all parts are simple.

a plurality is a subdivision of another iff for everything in the first there is a member of the second such that x is part of y.

everything has atomic parts <=> atoms compose everything.

Strong: iff for each  in xx there is no y != x : yDx and (ii) for each compositve y exists subplurality yy of xx : y=sigma yy 

3d world is not separable. if we all agree that our intuitions are actually false even of the 3d world that actually generated them, why assumed they're true at all?

Fundamentally1: undetermined. (unexplained)
F2: determine everything. (explain everything)
f(12): undetermined all-determiners (unexplained all-explainers)

Strong => fundamental(12).

weak => fundamental(2)

sigma-simplicity => (weak sep => exists strong sep)

need determination principle: for every 3d entity x there is a configuration space plurality xx such that xx D x.

but converse fails. fundamentality(12) fails to entail the compositoin and determination condition. requires that for every derivative entity y there is a fundamental plurality xx that determines y. However it is completely silent as to whether y and xx are sigma-related as strong-separability demands.

so: want separability because it guarantees fundamentality.

bias towards f2 (orthodox may be f1): suppose x, y depend on each other, and determine everything else.
