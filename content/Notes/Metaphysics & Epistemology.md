Generality: be responsive to cases
Flexibility: Don't entail location

Delegation theory of presence

> A delegation structure <P, D+, D-, @?, D> where
> P: set of positions
> D+ set of delegators
> D- set of delegates
> @ set of two-place locative relations : @i $\subseteq$ D- x Pi
> D: three-place relation : D $\subseteq$ D+ x D- x P

Intuitively: delegators delegate their presence in P to another thing , their delegate in D-, that is somehow located in @

x weakly located at y iff x is to be found in y
x pervasively located at y iff x completely fills y
x entirely located at y iff x lies within y
x exactly located at y iff x perfectly fits in y without any gaps

exact => entire
exact => pervasive
entire => weak
pervasive => weak

delegates are at least weakly located at the relevant place of delegation, cannot perform duties in absentia; but delegators can. (But what if I hire a lawyer, who hires a lawyer, who...?)

Some more principles, e.g., of transitivity, auto-delegation, etc.

Presence: for x to be present at y is for x to have a delegate at y

Occupant: for x to be an occupant of a system P is for it to be weakly located at a position in P

Proper Delegate: what it sounds like (distinct from delegator)

Claim: location entails presence. This follows from auto-delegation!

Weak location theory of presence: fails flexibility requirement

Delegate location theory of presence: for x to be present at place y is for it to be weakly located at one of its delegates at y. Fails generality requirement.

Stronger than delegation theory, in the presence of principle p3

primitive theory: presence is irreducible to notions such as location and delegation, even if it might display some substantive connections to them, and should not be defined in their terms.

a perdurant delegates its proper temporal parts at a time, an endurant delegates itself, a social entity delegates its members, a universal delegates of of the things that exemplify it, a contingent object delegates its counterparts (induced relations)

might allow higher-order identities between presence and these induced relations. 

an induced relation is location conducive iff it entails that the delegator is weakly located at the place of delegation; exlusive, indifferent clear generalizations

Loc Con requires delegator to be there; occupany only requires it to be somewhere in the system.

### Belief Change as Evidence
**Elise Woodard (KCL)**

Motivating Case: I'm against some position; I learn that you used to be against it, for the same reasons, but then changed your mind.

The View:

This can provide
1. zetetic ('inquiric') reasons to investigate further
2. second-order evidence (a) that there is more evidence out there, and (b) about the quality of your reasoning

But not when
1. It's not a genuine change of mind
2. There's overwhelming counterevidence against the adopted view

Minimal pairs (over, say, the relative importance of family, or philosophical pragmatism)
1. A and B disagree, and always have.
2. A and B disagree, but B used to agree with A.

Being A in version 2 seems much more worrying!

Changes of mind:
- Not just any belief-revision (just as forgetting is not just any loss of knowledge)
- Indicator of epistemic improvement
- Epistemic virtue and avoiding certain biases
- Evidence of epistemic superiority & empathy

(So, like, this is why we give the advice to be able to argue for your opponents' positions at least as well as they can themselves. Also, this is why people parade around, say, religious converts.)
