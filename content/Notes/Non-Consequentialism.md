Notes from graduate seminar with Hilary Greaves and Tomi Francis on whether moderate ('half-hearted') or radical ('thoroughgoing') non-consequentialist moral theories are more plausible. The format seems to be a presentation with clarificatory questions for the first half of each class, and then substantive discussion on questions as decided by Slido votes.

I find it difficult to write emails sometimes, but I thought my permission email was good. (I basically just use this as a template for all graduate class permission emails.)

## Week 1: Introduction

Pre-reading was a set of introductory notes that Hilary had written; a lot of it is fairly familiar material ('all of what you might cover in an undergraduate moral philosophy course, and a little bit more besides'), but we were promised that after this week there would be a gear shift into research-level material. So not many content-notes here.

I think there are plausibly non-welfare goods, and I'm not sure what the principled line is for when something becomes non-consequentialist. Talked a bit with Tomi (who I'd met before) in slightly more detail about ruling out 'gimmicky' consequentialized non-consequentialist theories; a working hypothesis is that it suffices to require that axiology is sufficiently objective (in particular, not time-relative and not agent-relative).

Submitted a question about whether expected-value consequentialism was really more action-guiding: I can't perfectly access what my evidence is (there are many failures of negative introspection, where I don't know that I don't actually know something), or what it says is best. We can follow objective rules like 'Add salt' (without needing 'Do what, for all you know, would add salt'). It got four upvotes and went third (I considered upvoting my own question, but it wouldn't have changed how soon it went, so I didn't). I was going to include a disclaimer about how other arguments for EVC seemed better, but there wasn't enough space (and asking 'Could other arguments work better?' seemed silly, as we saw a better argument in the pre-reading).

The better argument in question: the secondary norm generated by objective consequentialism doesn't actually match up with EVC, and EVC seems right where they conflict. (Suppose pill A has 1% chance to cure the patient fully, 99% chance to kill the patient painfully; pill B has 100% chance to cure the patient but give her a headache.) Sometimes the right thing to do, given what you know, is not the right thing to do all things considered.

## Week 2: The Linguistic Objection to Axiology

Objections to the axiologist's notions of betterness from ordinary language. Main pre-readings are Thomson ('The right and the good') versus Mankowitz ('Good people are not like good knives'), and there was a cool overview handout, too. We're interested in reasons for selective skepticism about betterness (by contrast with across-the-board skepticism of all moral notions).

### Thomson

Thoimson on Moore:
- Moore's story:
  1. There is such a property as goodness
  2. There is such a relation of betterness (comparative goodness)
  3. Rightness is analyzable in terms of betterness (maximizing consequentialism)
- This leads to paradox of deontology ('if wrongs are so bad, why shouldn't you wrong to prevent them?'). Commonly, people will deny (3). But Thomson thinks we should deny (1):
- First-order (contrast second-order) ways of being good have the form 'good + adjunct' ('rice is good to eat').
- Second-order ways include virtue properties of acts and people (X's being good in virtue of X's being kind, just, etc.) And so moral requirement is derivative from virtue properties.
- Second-order ways 'rest on' first-order ways, especially on goodness for particular people. (Virtue consequentialism: is people having trait X good for us?)

Greaves on Thomson:
- Ethics 101 picture includes consequentialism (bring about the best consequences), deontology (obey the rules), and virtue ethics (develop and manifest the virtues)
- Within virtue ethics, axiology could play two roles.
- - Foundational (which traits count as virtues rather than vices, or neutral traits): determined by what's conducive to the good.
  - Content level: one of the virtues is beneficence (aiming to promote the good). But is it a virtue? Is it a matter of aiming to promote the good?
- But can't we give a similar account for goodness of states of affairs?
- Doesn't she leave out non-welfare goods (beauty, intact ecosystems, ...), and so commit herself to a strong sort of welfarism?
