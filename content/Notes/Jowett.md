"So far, none have been found to be convincing, but that doesn't mean that the next one won't!"

A is green
A is examined before t
So: A is grue


B is not examined before t
So B is green
So B is grue

Claim: (Green) is doxastically independent of defeated evidence.

### Basic Idea

Claim: Cannot use something which is evidenced by defeated evidence 


($F$ or $G$) is _derivatively defeated_ because its evidence _doxastically depends_ on the evidence for a directly defeated hypothesis.

$\Box(\lnot B(a_i\text{ is } F) \to \lnot B(\_i\text{ is } F\text{ or } G))$.

grastic := green iff made of plastic

N is green and plastic, so grastic.

Probably M is green and plastic, so grastic. But not green. So then grastic is inductively inert.

Note doxastic priority is not conceptual priority!

In AGM: Update inductively closed belief base

### In Bayesianism

Most solutions go by low priors in grue. Different way:

Let 0 < x << 0.5 << y < 1

cr(a is plastic) = high
cr(a is green) = high

plastic and green independent. this is what it means to be basic here.

cr(a is grastic) = high

Induction:
cr(b is plastic) = high
cr(b is green) = high

Defeater: condition on some info which brings cr(b plastic) = low.

Let defeater event be independent of green!!

Normative Principle: preservation of independence under induction.

Do we need this?? or should we just say that the defeater is something like conditioning on an event, and that event is independent of the green hypothesis? obviously this won't hold if the evidence is, like, 'the a n+1 is not one of the AA'.

But then this is just to say that the defeater leaves the 'green' part alone. Umm?

Why does projected independence of green and plastic have anything to do with it?? Doesn't it just depend on how we reduce cr(green)?


green is independent of examined??


question: Why does projected independence of green and plastic have anything to do with it? Why isn't it just the independence of the defeater from the 

answer: because conditioning on (the counterpart of) the defeater in the original case doesn't reduce the probability of green in the original case.


Well, let's say induction works as follows:

We take y to be drawn from the same distribution as the xx. We know some stuff about the distribution of the xx, from previous observations of the xx.


We shouldn't project dependence relations on what we believe about some particular x from observation.

We should project what we believe about the distribution of the xx. 

have to buy jeffrey conditionalization + inductive independence?

xy + (1-x)(1-y)


okay, so: 


joint distribution on green and plastic


If cr(a is F) = cr(a is F | a if G) then

cr(b is F) = cr(b if F | b is G)


Why not more general:

cr(a is F | a is G) = cr(a is F | a is G)

cr(grue) low because cr(green) and cr(unexamined) both high.
