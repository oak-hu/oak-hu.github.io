Question: why do people deny conditional proof ($\to$Intro) for English 'if'.

'Subset' is a very natural strict strictly partial order


Much likelier to be set 'show that this sentence is satisfiable' (and must produce an infinite domain) rather than showing that this sentence is not satisfiable on a finite domain.
