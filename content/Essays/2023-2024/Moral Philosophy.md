This is the class that I think I've put the most work into. Here's the feedback I got from my tutor:

> Oak's work on Mill has been stellar. She writes extremely sophisticated philosophical prose at the level of a good graduate student. The only issue is that occasionally she tries to pack in too much in too short a space, leading to unclarity. By the end of our four sessions, after I had warned her of this, it looked like she had overcome this tendency; but she would still be well advised to bear this issue in mind.

Funny story: after I finished my last essay, I decided to go through and rewrite the entire thing to make it move as slowly as possible. You can see both versions below.

I also got an 80 on my collections essay for moral philosophy, which I'm quite proud of.
