Consider the following sentence:[^1]

> Only one of the students believes in herself.

I claim that this sentence is false (or at least has an acceptable false reading) in the situation where just two of the students, Artemis and Apollo, each believe in themselves.[^2] The sentence is (paraphraseable to) an instance of the following schema:

> Only one of the $xx$ has $F$.

An instance is true just in case (i) some $x_1$ among the $xx$ has $F$, and (ii) every distinct $x_2\neq x_1$ among the $xx$ lacks $F$. In our particular case, the $xx$ must be the students, and $F$ must be ($\lambda x.x$ believes in herself), where 'herself' is anaphoric on $x$ — that is, to have $F$, one must have $G$, which is ($\lambda x.x$ believes in $x$).

Now, Artemis believes in herself, so (i) is satisfied. So, if our sentence is false, it must be that (ii) is not satisfied. That is, it must be that some distinct student, who is not Artemis, has $F$. By stipulation, the only student other than Artemis who has $G$ (and so might have $F$) is Apollo. So, Apollo has $F$ — Apollo believes in herself!

So, gendered pronouns can (at least in some cases) refer to someone who does not have the corresponding sex.

Nevertheless, in the overwhelming majority of cases, pronoun gender tracks sex. I claim that this function is important. Sex is socially important information, not least because males perpetuate the vast majority of violence, and sexual violence in particular. And it is _sex_, rather than gender identity, which matters here.

[^1]: This argument inspired from Sudo's (2012) thesis.
[^2]: This singular 'they' is plausibly a fake plural — like 'the boys each wore their yellow raincoat**s** today' — and so should be audible even to those who otherwise don't hear singular 'they' (like Paul Elbourne).
