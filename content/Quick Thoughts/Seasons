Winter is at the beginning of the year, autumn is at the end! But 'Winter 2024' sounds like it comes after 'Autumn 2024'. This is slightly annoying. Also, we often take Michaelmas to be Winter Term, Hilary to be Spring Term, and Trinity to be Summer Term; but Michaelmas is, like, entirely within Autumn, Hilary within Winter, and Trinity within Spring.
