Welcome! My name is Oak.[^1] I do math and philosophy at Magdalen College, Oxford.

On this site, you can find copies of my philosophy essays (for [[/2024-2025/Knowledge--and--Reality|undergraduate]] [[/2023-2024/Summer-Project|classes]]) and notes (for [[/2024-2025/Non-Consequentialism|graduate]] [[/2023-2024/Graduate-Classes|seminars]]). For more public-facing work, subscribe to my [[https://offhandquibbles.substack.com|Substack]]; for more personal stuff, follow my [[https://instagram.com/oak.hu|Instagram]].

I grew up reading LessWrong fairly uncriticially, so when I first got to Oxford, I found [[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/vzLrQaGPa9DNCpuZz/against-modal-logics|modal]] and [[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/2HxAkCG7NWTrrn5R3/three-fallacies-of-teleology|teleological]] notions a bit spooky. Despite my best efforts, I now think that the most progressive research programs in metaphysics and epistemology are those that take such notions as primitive.[^2]

I'm still broadly sympathetic to the Rationalist and Effective Altruist movements. I've [[https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/pledge/flow|pledged]] to donate 10% of my income (and 1% of spending money, while studying) to wherever it can do the most good, and I think you should too!

[^1]: Well, [[https://offhandquibbles.substack.com/p/quotes-and-quinean-quasi-quotes-quickly|technically]], my name is 'Oak'. My parents named me after Oklahoma State University, where they both went for graduate school after immigrating from China.
[^2]: There are two senses of 'primitive' here, which we can gloss as 'all-explaining' versus 'unexplainable'. These research programs attempt to explain things—like [[https://offhandquibbles.substack.com/p/counterfactuals|counterfactuals]] or [[https://offhandquibbles.substack.com/p/probability-for-philosophers|credences]]—in terms of necessity ('intensionalism') and knowledge ('knowledge-first'), so they take these notions as primitive in the first sense. But they need not take them as primitive in the second sense! For instance (helping ourselves to technical terms), we may define metaphysical necessity as the broadest objective modality, and knowledge as the most general factive stative propositional attitude.
