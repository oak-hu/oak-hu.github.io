Welcome! My name is Oak.[^1] I do math and philosophy at Magdalen College, Oxford.

On this site, you can find copies of my philosophy essays (for [[/2024-2025/Knowledge--and--Reality|undergraduate]] [[/2023-2024/Summer-Project|classes]]) and notes (for [[/2024-2025/Non-Consequentialism|graduate]] [[/2023-2024/Graduate-Classes|seminars]]). For more public-facing work, subscribe to my [[https://offhandquibbles.substack.com|Substack]]; for more personal stuff, follow my [[https://instagram.com/oak.hu|Instagram]].

I grew up reading LessWrong fairly uncriticially, so when I first got to Oxford, I found [[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/vzLrQaGPa9DNCpuZz/against-modal-logics|modal]] and [[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/2HxAkCG7NWTrrn5R3/three-fallacies-of-teleology|teleological]] notions a bit spooky. But Oxford's flagship research programs in metaphysics (intensionalism) and epistemology (knowledge-first) take such notions as fundamental, explaining other things in terms of necessity and knowledge. For various reasons, I now think the latter approach is right; but of course I *would* think that, wouldn't I?

I'm still broadly sympathetic to the Rationalist and Effective Altruist movements. I've [[https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/pledge/flow|pledged]] to donate 10% of my income (and 1% of spending money, while studying) such that it can do the most good, and I think you should too!

[^1]: Well, [[https://offhandquibbles.substack.com/p/quotes-and-quinean-quasi-quotes-quickly|technically]], my name is 'Oak'. My parents named me after Oklahoma State University, where they both went for graduate school after immigrating from China.
