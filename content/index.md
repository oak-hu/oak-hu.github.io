Welcome! My name is Oak.[^1]

I do math and philosophy at Magdalen College, Oxford. On this site, you can find copies of essays (for [[/2024-2025/Knowledge--and--Reality|undergraduate]] [[/2023-2024/Summer-Project|classes]]) and notes (for [[/2024-2025/Non-Consequentialism|graduate]] [[/2023-2024/Graduate-Classes|seminars]]).

This site is very much a work-in-progress!

[^1]: Well, [[https://offhandquibbles.substack.com/p/quotes-and-quinean-quasi-quotes-quickly|technically]], my name is 'Oak'. My parents named me after Oklahoma State University, where they both went for graduate school after immigrating from China.
