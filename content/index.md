Welcome!

I do math and philosophy at Magdalen College, Oxford. On this site, you can find copies of essays (for [[/2024-2025/Knowledge--and--Reality|undergraduate]] [[/2023-2024/Summer-Project|classes]]) and notes (for [[/2024-2025/Non-Consequentialism|graduate]] [[/2023-2024/Graduate-Classes|seminars]]).

This site is very much a work-in-progress!
