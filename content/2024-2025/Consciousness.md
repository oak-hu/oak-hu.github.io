Special lectures with Elisabetta Sassarini and Mattia Cecchinato. Sympathetic to 'analytic' functionalism. (If you're not, psychophysical harmony is a problem!) When one of Tim's students calls a position 'exceptionalist', you know that they're about to argue against it.

## Week 1

Exceptionalists: consciousness poses a special problem to metaphysics and cognitive science.

Distinguish psychological vs. phenomenal consciousness.

We define *psychologically* conscious states by ostension:
* ability to discriminate, categorize, react to stimuli
* ... integrate information
* ... report mental states
* ... access own internal states
* ... attention
* ... control of behavior
* ... wakefulness
* etc.

Exceptionalists agree that psychological consciousness can be explained. This is the *easy* problem of consciousness.

We define *phenomenally* conscious states also by ostension:
* the way it feels to see colours
* ... be in pain
* ... hear a sound
* etc.

The *hard* problem involves the subjective aspect of experience. Exceptionalists agree that these are correlated with physical processes, but argue that there's a special explanatory gap. The hard problem is why these processes give rise to an 'inner life' at all.

The easy problems concern the explanation of cognitive functions; all that's needed is to specify a physical mechanism. The methods of cognitive science are well-suited to providing such explanations. So we should assume that, eventually, those sciences will provide such explanations. In slightly more detail:

* It's a conceptual fact that, say, reportability is nothing more than the ability of a system to report internal information. It's a conceptual mistake to say: you have explained the performance of the verbal report function, but you haven't explained reporability! (We analyze the phenomenon in functional terms). 
* And the sciences can find physical mechanisms that perform the relevant functions.

Example: reductive explanation of genes:
* individuate the relevant functions: storing, transmitting hereditary information from one generation to the next
* Find the physical mechanism that performs these functions: DNA

By contrast: hard problem does not *seem* to concern the performance of functions; so it persists even when all the relevant functions are explained. The question is why the performance of these functions accompanied by phenomenal experiences at all.

Example: Inverted spectrum
* two observers could be alike in all functional respects, but differ in the pheonmenal character of their experiences. they have the exact same behavior, with the same causes, and the same relations to other mental states. That is, in general, they are functionally indistinguishable. But it seems that there can be a phenomenal difference!

Example: Nation brain
* Suppose the entire population of China implemenets the functional organization of a human brain, each citizen corresponding to a neuron; this system would *clearly* not have phenomenal states. There can be states functionally indistinguishable from sensations, but lacking any phenomenal character.

(But: if our neurons could think, wouldn't they deny that our brains are conscious? They simply can't imagine a level up. Even if, say, they thought of our brains as being functionally just like their mini-brains.)

'Why doesn't all the information-processing go on "in the dark"?' (The lights are on, but nobody's home.)

So we claim that the first step towards a reductive explanation is not possible, because phenomenal concepts are not fully analyzable in functional terms.

35-75 Hz neural oscillations in the cerebral cortex $\to$ binding of information contents $\to$ synchronized oscillations of neuronal groups representing the relevant contents. So, the oscillations are the neural correlates of experience. By why do oscillations give rise to experience?? (But why do the liquid microstates give rise to liquidity??)

Physicalism: all states and properties are (necessitated by) physical states and properties. (What's a physical state / property, here? Feels hard to specify in the same way that 'naturalism' feels hard to specify.)

Some experionalists believe that the explanatory gap entails the falsity of physicalism, as (they claim) phenomenal properties / states cannot be reduced to physical properties / states.

But how can an epistemic premise about the explanation of pheonmenal states (the *explanatory* gap) entail a metaphysical conclusion about their nature?

> Suppose Fred has better color vision than anyone else on record; he makes every discrimination that nayone has ever made, and moreover he makes one that we cannot even begin to make. If you show him a batch of ripe tomatoes, he sorts them into two roughly equal groups, and does so with complete consistency \[...\] Basically, he sees two colours where we see one. (Jackson)

Similarly with Mary, from the same paper; what it's like to be a bat, from Nagel.

So we're to Fred as a red-green color-blind person is to us. We can do all the neuroscience on Fred that we want; but we'll never know what it's like for Fred to see these colors. The claim is that all the physical information still leaves underdetermined _all_ the information. (Guises? Know everything about piano playing, but not know how to play piano? In a similar way that someone can know all the information, but not the first-personal information: Stanford library or Harvard library? Or Lingens reading about Hesperus and Phosphorus in unhelpful guises ('Phosphorus is called "Phosphorus"'; but pretty much everything about Phosphorus is communicated under the guise of information about Hesperus.))

Nagel: 'People are now told at an early age that all matter is really energy. But despite the fact that people know what "is" means \[...\] like the claim uttered by a Pre-Socratic'

1. Physicalism is true iff all correct information is physical information (By definition)
2. We have complete physical information about Fred (By assumption)
3. We still don't know what it is like for him to see red (By assumption)
4. We don't have complete information about Fred (3) \[So the claim is that this doesn't follow from 3?\]
5. Physical information is not complete information (2, 4)
6. So, physicalism is false. (1, 5)

7. Actually i think this lecturer is quite bright (this is just, lik,e a very low-level course
8. i'm not saying that any of them are unintelligent, only that a lot are bad lecturers - i.e. not engaging, dry, etc. Worst offender: Volker
9. Is there a library nearby that we could go have a 5 hour long date in after this?
