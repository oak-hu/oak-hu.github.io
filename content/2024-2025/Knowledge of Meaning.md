Notes from a graduate class with Ian Rumfitt on how we know what things mean.

## Week 1: The Tractarian Thesis

### 1. The thesis
Wittgenstein: *4.024 Einen Satz verstehen, heißt, wissen was der Fall ist, wenn er wahr ist* ('To understand a declarative sentence means to know what is the case if it is true').

* Frege (parent): name of a truth value $\approx$ formalized sentence ($\approx$ a function from circumstances of evaluation to truth values?)
  * Wiggins: this is about Frege's *Begriffsschrift*, but can be generalized!
* Wittgenstein (siblings): '(4.022) A declarative sentence in use shows how things stand if it is true. And it says that they do so stand... (4.061) A declarative sentence in use is true if we use to say that things stand in a certain way and they do.'
* Davidson (child): Truth-conditions are (a type of) meaning.
* Strawson: 'Generally harmless and salutary...not the end, but the beginning of our task' (One thing to be true, another to be important) Meaning isn't truth, but what beliefs (or wishes or instructions) you can use it to communicate. ('Audience Directed Belief Expression')
  * Rumfitt is aligned with Strawson here (speech act theory); but we're aligned with Davidson (for the semantics, at least; the pragmatics we take to be built on top). Common knowledge of truth-conditions is just what allows performance of these communicative speech acts.
  * Full understanding requires, say, catching allusions; but knowledge of truth-condition is a central dimension.
* Obvious generalizations: to understand an imperative is to know under what conditions it is obeyed; to understand an interrogative is to know...?

Do we really want to say our philosophical opponents (say, Graham Priest) who disagree with us about the meanings to sentences don't understand the sentences they're uttering?

Why assume anything like this is true? I don't know the truth-conditions in any transparent guise (say, a non-transparent disquotational schema? What if it's really, really context-sensitive?).

### 2. What is a sentence?

* On a broadly Strawsonian view: roughly, something with which you can perform a complete speech act. By contrast with some expression which (together) has type <t>. Consider: 'Hello, Jemima'; 'Hurrah for Manchester United!'
* Frege's context principle: only ask for the meaning of a word in the context of a sentence. 'Only in the context of a sentence does a word mean anything'. (Wait, what? Seems quite weird, and in tension with Frege's thesis.)

### 3. The individuation of sentences

* Austin: To perform a _locutionary_ act is to (a) utter a _phone_ (certain noises), (b) utter a _pheme_ (certain lexical items in a grammatically okay way), and (c) perform a _rhetic_ act (do so with a more or less definite sense and reference).
* Example: The same phone 'flying planes can be dangerous' corresponds to two English phemes.
* Also useful to treat lexical items as having their meanings necessarily, and 'other meanings' as different homophonous items.
* We identify sentences with phemes; in particular, those whose utterance may perform a complete speech act.

Is it open to the Strawsonian to individuate things in this way? It seems like you have to buy some realist-y notions. (Or, I guess I don't understand how you can go syntax-first.) 'Ann!' seems to count (as a greeting from a friend, an imperative from a parent, ...) without any obvious elided content (versus in answer to, say, 'Who smokes?'). So, does 'Ann smokes' contain the subsentence 'Ann'?

Response: *in 'Ann smokes', 'Ann' isn't *used* as a sentence; so it's not a subsentence.* But 'Ann smokes, and Jane dances' doesn't use 'Ann smokes' as a sentence, yet 'Ann smokes' is surely a subsentence in a way that 'Ann' isn't!

'The proposition that arithmetic is incomplete was first proved by Godel?' Does the ideology of propositions even make sense here, for necessary truths?

### 4. The classification of sentences

* Claim: it's unfruitful to try and find differences in speech acts, say, in telling someone that something is the case, or to do something.
* Example: 'In this house, we remove our shoes before entering'. (Similar: 'You do it like this'.)
* In these cases, you're committed to postulating some ambiguity, or something, between truth-apt uses and imperative uses.

**Can we assimilate all imperatives to declaratives, where the imperative force is pragmatic? We derive 'make it such that P' (Altshuler) from a patently false 'P'.**

* Example: 'A-company will parade at ten thirty tomorrow morning'. Same truth-conditions, but from a tour guide the speaker is responsible for the truth of the sentence, whereas from a general the audience is responsible for the truth of the sentence.

(Someone asks a discussion on why you can't assimilate declaratives to imperatives. But declaratives-first is just, as a matter of fact, a much more successful and promising research program than the hypothesized imperatives-first alternative.)

### Declarative sentences

* 'No one would assign truth-conditions to "let's go"'. (But why not? '[You] let us go' is true iff the audience does let them go.)
I thought the proposal was to assimilate all of these apparently non-declarative things to pragmatic derivations from declaratives? But The answer here was that we need to keep in mind even distinctions between, say, ordering and telling to and inviting in order to classify sentences.

(We ran out of time before finishing the handout.)
