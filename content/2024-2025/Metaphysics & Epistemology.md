Generality: be responsive to cases
Flexibility: Don't entail location

Delegation theory of presence

> A delegation structure <P, D+, D-, @?, D> where
> P: set of positions
> D+ set of delegators
> D- set of delegates
> @ set of two-place locative relations : @i $\subseteq$ D- x Pi
> D: three-place relation : D $\subseteq$ D+ x D- x P

Intuitively: delegators delegate their presence in P to another thing , their delegate in D-, that is somehow located in @

x weakly located at y iff x is to be found in y
x pervasively located at y iff x completely fills y
x entirely located at y iff x lies within y
x exactly located at y iff x perfectly fits in y without any gaps

exact => entire
exact => pervasive
entire => weak
pervasive => weak

delegates are at least weakly located at the relevant place of delegation, cannot perform duties in absentia; but delegators can. (But what if I hire a lawyer, who hires a lawyer, who...?)

Some more principles, e.g., of transitivity, auto-delegation, etc.

Presence: for x to be present at y is for x to have a delegate at y

Occupant: for x to be an occupant of a system P is for it to be weakly located at a position in P

Proper Delegate: what it sounds like (distinct from delegator)

Claim: location entails presence. This follows from auto-delegation!

Weak location theory of presence: fails flexibility requirement

Delegate location theory of presence: for x to be present at place y is for it to be weakly located at one of its delegates at y. Fails generality requirement.

Stronger than delegation theory, in the presence of principle p3

primitive theory: presence is irreducible to notions such as location and delegation, even if it might display some substantive connections to them, and should not be defined in their terms.

a perdurant delegates its proper temporal parts at a time, an endurant delegates itself, a social entity delegates its members, a universal delegates of of the things that exemplify it, a contingent object delegates its counterparts (induced relations)

might allow higher-order identities between presence and these induced relations. 

an induced relation is location conducive iff it entails that the delegator is weakly located at the place of delegation; exlusive, indifferent clear generalizations
