I practice the two great armchair disciplines—mathematics and philosophy—at Magdalen College, Oxford. In other words, I'm overly fond of elegant formalizations within metaphysics, epistemology, and the philosophy of language. I took my preliminary examinations in philosophy, politics, and economics, earning a distinction.

Testing, testing.
