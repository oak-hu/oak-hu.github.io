# Distinctions in Theoretical Philosophy

> The following are some notes from a graduate seminar, mostly consisting of ~novel observations rather than recapitulations of the content (as I had on the old version of my site), although I'll try to include some minimal exposition. This class was on distinctions in theoretical philosophy, run by Bernhard Salow in Hilary Term 2026.

## Inquiry (Week 1)

Friedman (2024) argues that suspending judgement on Q is to be in an inquiring state of mind, which is necessary for inquiring (otherwise, you're just collecting evidence: consider a cleaner who collects the same things as a detective) but not sufficient for inquiring (you might not collect any evidence). Left-to-right direction is fairly plausible, right-to-left is less clear.

Someone suggests grasping what an inquiring state of mind is supposed to be by comparing to an assertive state of mind (what actors lack, for instance), prompted some discussion about whether an inquiring state of mind carries any commitments. Someone suggests some flavour of possibiility, Bernhard suggests to the presuppositions: say, the question of how many people went to the party, while being unsure about whether there was a party. But suppose I do want to know how many people went to the party, but first need to find out whether it happened. Isn't the most natural way to describe what I'm doing to the first question suspending judgement? Bernhard explains the point well: Friedman plausibly shows that you can't or shouldn't believe that the presupposition is false, but perhaps you don't need to be all the way on the other side of the spectrum and believe that the presupposition is true.

Friedman notes that sometimes rediscovering something is easier than recalling it, but says that there's still a basic epistemic conflict or incoherence here. But consider a concrete case: I have some mathematical formula that I can recall (so in particular, that I know), but it's easier to rederive it every time I need it. This seems completely epistemically kosher—indeed, there would be something wrong with *not* just working it out again—which tells against the ignorance norm (only inquire if you're ignorant) that Friedman posits. (It should be guise-relativised anyway, but this would affect a revised version too.) Bernard says it's a good case, and that although it might seem weird to describe you as (say) wondering about what the formula is, maybe this is just an artefact of it being weird to wonder instead of just working it out, if it really is that quick to work out. But suppose we use a present-awareness (guise-relativised) standard for knowledge, such that facts remembered which aren't in view don't count. The norm is just: don't use the harder route to settle the question. Then, you typically shouldn't collect new evidence, because it's easier to recall; but in cases where it's easier to collect new evidence, you shouldn't recall.
