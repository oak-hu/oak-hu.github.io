# Directly Causing Inconsistency

_Singular direct causation features prominently in our ethical (Byrne forthcoming), legal (Byrne 2023), and metalinguistic reasoning (Martin 2018, a.o.). I argue that it is to be understood as a metaphysical analogue of the metalinguistic relation of witnessing from mathematical logic: whereas the latter relates to an existentially quantified sentence, the former relates to a proposition. I prove that direct causation is inconsistent with the view that necessary equivalence suffices for propositional identity, and direct causation by propositions or events is inconsistent outright. Such results are fundamental limitations on any Strawsonian (1951) project of descriptive metaphysics. I then take up a revisionary metaphysical project, showing how Martin’s (2018) account of direct causation can be improved to yield sufficiency in context (compare Kodsi and Kaiserman, manuscript). This is an attractive replacement for direct causation, as well as for causation more generally._

## Introduction

In his _Individuals: An Essay in Descriptive Metaphysics_ (1951), P. F. Strawson
wrote that he was “content to describe the actual structure of our thoughts
about the world” (p. 9). After all,

> _there are categories and concepts which, in their most fundamental character, change not at all. Obviously these are not the specialities of the most refined thinking. They are the commonplaces of the least refined thinking; and are yet the indispensable core of the conceptual equipment of the most sophisticated human beings_ (p. 10).
